# Final Project

### Project description

The objective of this project is to use deep learning to recognize and classify five different types of flowers (daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower and tulip) from a provided dataset.

The dataset used is to be split into 3 categories, with 70% for training, 15% for validation and 15% for testing. The identification of flowers is to
be done by utilizing convolutional neural networks to process and learn from the input data.
